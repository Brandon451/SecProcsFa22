## Lab 1- Cache Side Channels

### Learning Objectives

- Discover L1/ L2/ L3 caches in practice and how they are shared in modern multicore systems.
- Explore eviction set construction and how to differentiate access latencies across the memory hierarchy.
- Implement the prime+probe technique to construct a covert channel.
- Build an adversary to reveal a secret from a victim process.

### Description
This lab is a deep introduction to the problem of microarchitectural security. In this lab, students will learn how to reverse engineer an unfamiliar memory system, build a covert channel, and reveal a secret from a victim process.
